Act as a Senior Israeli Mortgage Consultant (Yoetz Mashkanta) and Financial Risk Analyst.
I need a comprehensive, deep-dive research report on the most common and effective "Tamheel" (Mortgage Mix) structures currently being executed in the Israeli market for late 2024/2025.

**Context:**
We are in a high-interest rate environment (BoI Base Rate ~4.5%), with uncertainty regarding inflation and potential future rate cuts. The standard "1/3 Prime, 1/3 Kalats, 1/3 Tzamud" mix is likely outdated or suboptimal.

**Research Objectives:**

1.  **The "Standard" Benchmark:**
    *   What is the default mix banks are offering to average borrowers today?
    *   Why do banks prefer this mix? (Profitability vs. Risk).

2.  **Strategic Borrower Profiles (The "Smart" Mixes):**
    *   **The "Aggressive Payer":** For a borrower who plans to close the loan in <10 years. How high should the Prime component go?
    *   **The "Inflation Hater":** For a risk-averse borrower fearing a "Lost Decade" of inflation. What is the optimal ratio of Kalats (Fixed Unlinked) vs. Prime?
    *   **The "Cash Flow Optimizer":** For investors who need the lowest monthly payment *now* to pass DTI (Debt-to-Income) checks, even if it costs more later. How are they using the Katz (CPI-Linked) track to artificially lower initial payments?

3.  **Optimization Mechanics:**
    *   **"Pituys" (Lures):** How are consultants using the "Mishtana" (Variable every 5 years) track as a temporary "Lure" to lower the weighted average rate, intending to refinance it later?
    *   **Regulatory Arbitrage:** How are sophisticated borrowers bypassing the "Prime Limit" (historically 1/3, now relaxed) using specific bank policies?

4.  **Quantitative Data (Estimates):**
    *   Provide the typical interest rate spreads for each track *relative* to the anchor.
    *   Example: "Prime = P - 0.5%" vs "Prime = P + 0.0%".
    *   Example: "Kalats 20Y = Bond Yield + 1.5%".

**Output:**
Provide 3 specific, detailed "Tamheel" compositions (percentages for Prime/Kalats/Katz/Mishtana) with a rationale for *why* this specific mix works mathematically in the current economy.

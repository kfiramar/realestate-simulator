Tamheel Assumption Validation (with current data baked in)  
Goal: verify every assumption in the simulator against real-world 2025 Israeli data. Update values, sources, and logic. If anything is unknown, mark “unknown” and suggest the right user input or data pull.

What we currently assume (please confirm/correct with sources):

1) Historical series (replace hard-codes; prefer monthly)  
 - S&P 500: use Total Return (dividends reinvested), not price. Target 2005–2024 lookback. Source options: S&P TR index or ETF adjusted-close (e.g., SPY/VOO). Provide monthly TR if possible.  
 - Real estate: CBS Housing Price Index (prefer Tel Aviv district/Gush Dan). Nominal (not real). Provide series (bi-monthly CBS) or annualized CAGR.  
 - USD/ILS: Bank of Israel rep rate. Choose EOY spot for wealth snapshots; annual/monthly average for flows.  
 - CPI: store index level (base ~2024=100). Use Known Index (published mid-month) for payments. Provide monthly CPI changes.  
 - BoI policy rate: BoI cut to 4.25% on 24/11/2025. Prime rule = BoI + 1.5% ⇒ 5.75%. Use monthly/daily history, not annual.

2) Scenario presets (Bear/Base/Bull) – need realistic anchors  
 Current proposal (editable):  
  • Bear: SP 5.5%, RE 2.5%, CPI 3.5%, mortgage “high”, yield 3.8%, FX drift +1.5%  
  • Base: SP 8.0%, RE 4.0%, CPI 2.5%, mortgage “mid”, yield 3.3%, FX drift +0.5%  
  • Bull: SP 10.5%, RE 6.0%, CPI 1.8%, mortgage “low”, yield 2.8%, FX drift -0.5%  
  *Earlier validation also suggested Bear/Base/Bull: SP 4/9/12, RE -1/3.5/7, CPI 4.5/2.5/1.5, Prime 6.5/4.75/3.5, Yield 2.4/2.8/3.2, FX drift +3/0/-1.5. Please choose final targets.*  
  • Yield glide: starting yields in TLV are ~2.2–2.6%. A hard-coded glide 4.2→2.8 is unrealistic; propose mean-revert or flat per scenario.  
  • FX drift: must be user-configurable.

3) Sliders & bounds (deal structure)  
 - Down payment min must respect LTV by buyer type (BoI):  
   • Single dwelling: max LTV 75% (min 25% down)  
   • Replacement: max LTV 70% (min 30% down)  
   • Investment/non-resident: max LTV 50% (min 50% down)  
 - Term: 4–30y (1y step) is realistic; default 20–25y.  
 - Horizon: default locked to term; unlock 5–50y (step 1–2y).  
 - Costs: current Buy 2% / Sell 2% is wrong for investors.  
   • Purchase tax (Mas Rechisha) for investors: ~8% up to ~6.05M NIS, then 10%. First-home tiers start 0% to ~1.98M.  
   • Broker ~2% + VAT; lawyer ~0.5–1% + VAT; appraisal/origination ~0.2%.  
   • Exit: broker ~2% + VAT; lawyer ~0.5%. Optionally toggle Hetel Hashbacha (off by default).  
   • Maint/Vacancy: currently 10% of rent; confirm/adjust.

4) Tamheel tracks & rates (defaults should be data-driven; see mashfix.xls)  
 - Prime track: Prime = 5.75% (BoI 4.25 + 1.5). Market spreads vary: strong borrowers may get Prime -0.2 to -0.4; others Prime flat to +0.5. Default spread should be user input.  
 - Kalatz (fixed, unlinked): market ~4.85–5.10% for 20y (Nov 2025). Default ~4.90%.  
 - Katz (fixed, CPI-linked): market ~3.50–3.90% + CPI. Default ~3.60% real. Model linkage monthly before interest (Spitzer).  
 - Presets suggested:  
   • Shield: 50% Kalatz @4.90, 50% Prime @5.55 (P-0.2)  
   • Balanced/Arbitrage: 40% Prime, 30% Kalatz, 30% Katz  
   • Aggressive: 50% Katz, 50% Prime (low initial pay, high linkage risk)  
 - Regulatory: respect BoI caps on variable-rate exposure.

5) Taxes & thresholds (2025)  
 - Rent tax ceiling: 5,654 ₪/month (2025), updated annually (not monthly). Modes: full exemption, partial exemption formula up to 2× ceiling, 10% gross track; choose lowest liability.  
 - Capital gains: RE “Mas Shevach” 25% on real gain (primary home often exempt); securities 25% real gain; surtax 2% above ~721,560 ₪ income (toggle).  
 - Tax basis options: Real vs CPI for RE; FX/nominal options for USD assets—label as approximation and per-asset.

6) Fees & friction (S&P)  
 - Mgmt fee default 0.15% (low-cost ETF/broker). Banks often 0.3–0.6% custody—decide default.  
 - Trade fee: 0.1% is common; many brokers have a minimum per trade. Inputs should allow % + min (₪). Apply on every buy/sell (not just positive injections).

7) Optimizer & locks  
 - Search ranges: Down 25–100 (step 5), Term 10–30 (step 1), Horizon 5–50 (step 2 when unlocked). Adjust Down min per buyer type.  
 - Default locks: Horizon locked to term; Down/Term free.  
 - Sweet-spot arrows should honor locks only.

8) Cashflow & rent modeling  
 - Rent grows annually with CPI (or CPI + real rent growth), not monthly tracking price.  
 - Indexation: Katz principal linked monthly before interest; consider index lag (Madad Yadua, typically 1–2 months).  
 - Out-of-pocket logic: positive cashflow → invest in S&P after trade fee; negative → reduce S&P basis or treated as new equity.

9) KPIs / outputs  
 - ROI diff currently uses loser as base (% outperformance) and colors by winner; also show absolute NIS gap.  
 - Add: DSCR over time, LTV path, IRR for both strategies, NPV (user discount rate), max drawdown/worst year, payback/cash-on-cash.

10) Defaults to confirm/update (as of Nov 2025)  
 - BoI 4.25%, Prime 5.75% (BoI+1.5)  
 - SP base return ~7–8% (TR, nominal); Bull 9–12%; Bear 4–5%  
 - RE app base ~3–4% nominal (Tel Aviv cooling; Bear can be negative)  
 - Yield base ~2.6% (TLV entry); adjust per segment  
 - CPI base 2.5% (target); use CBS feed  
 - Down default 30% but enforce buyer-type LTV limits (25/30/50 min)  
 - Term default 20–25y; max 30y  
 - Mgmt fee 0.15%; Trade fee 0.1% + min?  
 - Rent tax mode: enable tracks, ceiling 5,654 ₪ (2025)  
 - Cap gains: 25% base; surtax toggle

Data to ingest  
 - mashfix.xls contains BoI “Average Rate of Interest on Unindexed Mortgages” (multiple sheets, incl. pre/post 2013 averages). Use as a source for Kalatz/Katz/Prime benchmarks.  
 - Answers.txt (this doc) contains all above corrections, sources, and suggested presets.  
 - External sources: BoI API (rep rate, FX), CBS API (CPI, HPI), BoI “Average mortgage interest rates” tables, Gov rent-tax thresholds (2025 = 5,654 ₪), Mas Rechisha brackets (investor 8–10% first bracket).

What to deliver back  
 - Confirm/correct every numeric assumption above.  
 - Provide updated series or URLs/CSVs for SP TR, HPI (Tel Aviv/National), CPI, BoI rate, FX USD/ILS.  
 - Provide updated scenario presets (Bear/Base/Bull) you approve.  
 - Provide recommended defaults for track rates (Prime spread, Kalatz, Katz) and buyer-type LTV rules.  
 - Provide correct tax thresholds, modes, and friction costs for 2025.  
 - Flag anything still unknown that must be user-configurable.***

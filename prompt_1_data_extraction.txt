Act as a Senior Macro-Economist and Chief Actuary for an Israeli Family Office.
Your task is to conduct a deep-dive financial research analysis to parameterize a 20-year Monte Carlo simulation model comparing:
A) **Israeli Residential Real Estate (Gush Dan/Center)**
B) **S&P 500 Equity Index (ILS Hedged & Unhedged)**

I require three robust, internally consistent economic scenarios for the period 2025-2045:
1.  **Bear Case (Stagflation/Geopolitical Stress):** High inflation, high BoI rates, sluggish growth, potential currency devaluation.
2.  **Base Case (Normalization):** Convergence to long-term averages, moderate growth, 2-3% inflation target achieved.
3.  **Bull Case (Tech Boom/Peace Dividend):** Low inflation, low rates, strong Shekel, high productivity growth.

### **Required Deep-Dive Data Points (Annualized Averages):**

For each scenario, provide the following parameters. Do NOT just guess; use historical precedence (2000-2024 data), demographic trends (Haredi/Arab population growth), and housing supply constraints to justify your numbers.

**1. Israel CPI (Madad):**
*   *Context:* Historical average is ~2%, but recent years hit 5%+. Consider the impact of war deficits on long-term inflation.

**2. Israel Real Estate Appreciation (Nominal):**
*   *Context:* Israeli RE has historically decoupled from global trends due to chronic supply shortage and high fertility rates. Does this continue?
*   *Formula:* `Inflation + Real_Growth`.

**3. Gross Rental Yield (Center TLV/Givatayim):**
*   *Context:* Currently very low (~2.5-3.0%). In a high-rate environment, does this expand or do prices fall?

**4. Bank of Israel (BoI) Base Rate:**
*   *Context:* The anchor for Prime mortgages. Correlated strongly with CPI + Real Neutral Rate.

**5. S&P 500 Nominal Return (USD):**
*   *Context:* Current CAPE ratios are high. Adjust forward-looking returns accordingly (don't just use the 10% historical average blindly).

**6. USD/ILS Exchange Rate Drift:**
*   *Context:* Critical for unhedged S&P comparisons.
*   *Positive %:* USD strengthens (Shekel weakens - e.g., geopolitical risk).
*   *Negative %:* Shekel strengthens (Tech sector export boom).

### **Output Format:**

Provide a detailed reasoning section for EACH scenario explaining the "Why" behind your numbers, followed by this exact JSON structure:
